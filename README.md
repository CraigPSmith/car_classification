# car_classification
The aim of this project was to create a car classifier by which images of cars are scraped from a website and then a model built to determine the make and model of the car based on the image provided.

## Image Scrape

In order to get the images of cars to be used to train a car classifier, images of 7 different cars were scraped from a popular car selling website.
